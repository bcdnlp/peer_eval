Firstly, the response is not relevant to the prompt and does not provide any useful information or assistance. Additionally, the response is not written in a clear or concise manner, making it difficult to understand what the assistant is trying to communicate. The response also lacks any sort of structure or organization, making it difficult to follow the assistant's thought process.\n\nIn contrast, Assistant 2's submission is much more promising. The code is well-structured and easy to read, with clear comments that explain the logic and functionality of the code. The code also demonstrates a good understanding of the problem at hand and implements an efficient solution. However, there are a few areas where the code could be improved. For example, the `transform()` function could be replaced with a loop that performs the same operation on each character in the string. Additionally, the `stringstream` object could be constructed directly from the `string` object, rather than using a `stringstream` object to read the line from the file and then converting it to a `string` object.
