Simplify the equation by moving all the terms to one side and the numbers to the other: 3x + 10 = 5(x - 2)\n2. Combine the terms on the left-hand side by subtracting 5x from both sides: 3x = 5x - 10\n3. Simplify the left-hand side by dividing both sides by 3: x = (5/3) - 10/3\n4. Take the natural logarithm of both sides to get the solution in terms of the natural logarithm base e: ln|x| = ln|(5/3) - 10/3| = ln|5/3| - ln|10/3|\n5. Exponentiate both sides to get the solution in terms of e: x = e^(-ln|x|) = e^(-ln|(5/3) - 10/3|)\n6. Rearrange the solution to get x in terms of Euler's number: x = e^(-ln|(5/3) - 10/3|) = e^(-ln|5/3| - ln|10/3|) = e^(-ln|5/3|) \\* e^(-ln|10/3|)\n7. Simplify the solution by canceling out the common factor of e from both parts of the exponent: x = (5/3)^(-ln|5/3|) \\* (10/3)^(-ln|10/3|)\n8.
